# Name Generator README
Generate names using syllables from various language banks.

*Note:
Ensure that the Languages directory is filled with appropriate language files.*

## How to use:

### Java app
1. Run the program (either build a new one, or run the name_generator.jar file).
    1. Make sure a "Languages" dir exists alongside your working directory, filled with language files.
2. Select the language you wish to use.
3. Select the amount of names you want generated.
4. Click generate.
5. If you wish to, select save to create a .txt file of the generated names.

#### Creating a language:
1. Create a new .txt file in the Languages directory.
2. Ensure the first line of the file reads the name of the language.
3. Add ALL the syllables on the second line, each seperated by a comma.
4. Save and re-open the app.

### Web app
1. Open index.html in a browser of your choice.
2. Select the language from the top bar.
3. This will generate five names for you.
4. Repeat until you get what you like!
